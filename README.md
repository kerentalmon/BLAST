Under-ranked localization scheme - solving ambiguity problem of 2 receivers - SHARKS DATA
The MATLAB code here is demo for T. Alexandri, Z. Z. Shamir, E. Bigal, A. Scheinin, D. Tchernov and R. Diamant, "Localization of Acoustically Tagged Marine Animals in Under-Ranked Conditions," in IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, vol. 20, no. 3, pp. 1126-1137, 1 March 2021, doi: 10.1109/TMC.2019.2959765.
The shark's data is already processed from the raw receiver records. The code plots the results for a sequence of 8 shark's positions out of which one serves as an anchor and the rest is derived from data take from only two receivers and compared to ground through â€“ data analyzed from 3three receivers.
